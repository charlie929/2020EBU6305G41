      <p>The Loess Plateau is a plateau or high plain that covers more than 250,000 sq mi in the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River in China. Also referred to as the Huangtu Plateau, the plateau encompasses the following provinces: Gansu, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Ningxia, and the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia. 
       </p>
      <p>Over 50 million people live on or are dependent on the plateau, which was once covered in fertile soil that was ideal for agriculture. However, centuries of overgrazing, deforestation, and population pressure resulted in the degradation of the ecosystem, and finally to desertification. In fact, the plateau's soil is considered to be the most highly erodible soil on Earth. </p>
      <p>By 2005, the rehabilitation project had resulted in some level of improvement, as more trees and grass remain green. Although the Chinese government no longer plays an active role in managing the erosion, sustainable policies by local governments, the participation of local communities, technical support, and improved agricultural systems continue to rehabilitate and improve the plateau. 
      Agricultural income has improved considerably and more than 20 million people have been lifted out of extreme poverty. In addition, bans on field grazing and deforestation have increased perennial vegetation to 34%. </p>
