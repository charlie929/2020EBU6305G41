                            <strong>Breakfast</strong> in Zhangjiajie's hotels is very basic, so your guide will prepare bread, coffee, and fruit for you.
                            <br><br><strong>Zhangjiajie National Forest Park</strong> is located in Wulingyuan Scenic Area, about 40 minutes' drive from the city. Tianzi Mountain and Yuanjiajie are the most classic and popular sites in Zhangjiajie.
                            <br><br>To save your time and energy, we will arrange the cable car (or elevator) trips to take you up and down the mountain. Take the cable car up <strong>Tianzi Mountain</strong>, and look through the glass walkway to see large areas of spiky sandstone peaks below that are thrusting up from the ground.
                            <br><br>Have a simple lunch on the mountain. If you prefer, we can arrange for you to have lunch at a McDonald's on the mountain, and have a break in the air-conditioned building.

They contain a local snack street, a folk culture souvenir street, and a bar street.

                            <strong>Baofeng Lake</strong> is in a basin created by the terrain in the middle of this mountainous area. A walk of about 20 minutes is needed before you reach the lake and take a wooden boat for a 30-minute boat ride. It is a leisurely experience as you float across the clear water, see the hills of various shapes, and enjoy entertainment by the local minority people as they sing their traditional songs.
                            <br><br><strong>Tianmen Mountain</strong> is regarded as the 'soul' of Zhangjiajie, being its highest mountain. The views include graceful ancient trees, karst hillocks, and long roads that are carved from the sides of the cliff. The cable car takes 30 minutes to get from the city center to the mountain top and is the longest cable car in the world.
                            <br><br>Your heart will beat quickly at Tianmen Mountain on the world's longest cable car, the suspended glass walkway that is almost a mile (1,430 meters) above the ground, and the '99 Bends' mountain road.
                            <br><br><strong>Tianmen Cave</strong> (literally meaning 'Heaven's Gate Hole') is a 30-meter-high hole formed naturally in the mountain like a doorway. It is well-known for being glided through by a world-class stuntman in a wing suit. To reach the hole, you can climb for about half an hour up the 'Stairway to Heaven'.
                            <br><br><strong>Zhangjiajie is an amazing place for photography!</strong>
                            <br>Using the photographic advice given by your professional tour guide, no matter who you are or what equipment you use, you can create a masterpiece.

					<article class="ac-large">
						<p>
                            It takes about 5 hours to drive from Zhangjiajie to Fenghuang, so it is better to start the day early. Although it's a long journey, you won't be bored on the way!
                            <br><br>On the way to the Fenghuang Ancient Town, you will visit the <strong>Red Stone Forest National Geopark</strong>. It is an area comprised of the Red Stone Forest
                            <br><br>Karst Landform Scenic Area, Gorge Scenic Area, underground rivers, lakes, waterfalls, and cave scenic spot.
                            <br><br>In the Red Stone Forest National Geopark, you will see many <strong>strangely-shaped rocks</strong> everywhere. They are in different poses and totally natural. In the past, these rocks were called cornerstones, also known as "pagoda stones" or "the Chinese cornerstones".
                            <br><br>Different from other ancient towns in China, <strong>Fenghuang Ancient Town</strong> is a secluded and tranquil town located on the bank of the river and surrounded by mountains. It is a good idea to stroll in this ancient town and visit some interesting shops and homes, and discover some interesting nooks. The ethnic handicrafts are really delicate and special in this region. At night, the town becomes more quiet and peaceful. Sitting in a bar and appreciating the sunset is wonderful.
                            <br><br><strong>Evening recommendation</strong>:
                            <br>The night view of Fenghuang Ancient Town is beautiful and attracts many photographers. In your free time, it is recommended that you find a café beside the Tuo River, sit down, and enjoy the nighttime scenery!
